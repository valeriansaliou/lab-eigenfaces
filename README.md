Face recognition algorithm implementation, using the eigenfaces technique.

# Required environment

 * MATLAB v9+

# How to use

 1. Open MATLAB
 2. Source the `eigenfaces.m` script in its base directory
 3. Play the script (the processing, recognition and validation will be automatically launched sequentially)
